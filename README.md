# Guide to Transfer your subreddits and users

All your subscribed ( joined ) subreddits and users will be transferred to your new or another account. Don't worry it copies them not moves.

## Step 1:
Go to this [Reddit link](https://old.reddit.com/subreddits/) with your old account.

## Step 2:
Open your browser dev tools and go to the console tab ( for chrome/edge/brave press F12 ). If you see any red errors don't worry just ingnore it.

## Step 4:
You will get a link like this in the console tab, if you have subscribed to more than 100 subreddits you will get multiple links. For example, 1000 subreddits will generate 10 links.

Bonus Tip: You can Backup your Subreddits and Users by saving all the generated links in a text file

## Step 5:
Right-click on the generated links and select "copy link address". Don't do CTRL+C and CTRL+V  this link is Shortned by the browser

## Step 6:
Paste them in a different browser's address/search bar where your new account is logged in. If you have multiple links then paste them one by one in new tabs. For example if the above code generates 10 links then paste one link in one new tab, so 10 links = 10 tabs. All the new subreddit will have green join buttons and common subreddits of those two accounts will have red leave button.

Tip: If you don't have a second browser just open an incognito tab and login into your new account where you want to transfer those subreddits.

Here I switched from Edge ( old account ) to Chrome ( new account ).

This is how the generated [link](https://old.reddit.com/r/Android+AndroidOnWindows+FlutterDev+Infinity_For_Reddit+Kotlin+Magisk+MotoG+Vanced+WSA+Windows11+androidapps+androiddev+announcements+motorola+windowsinsiders+xManagerApp/) looks 👇. YOURS WILL BE DIFFERENT, DON'T COPY THIS EXAMPLE LINK, COPY YOURS.

## Step 7:
Copy and Paste this [code](https://github.com/Tetrax-10/Ultimate-Subredddit-Transfer/blob/main/auto%20subscriber.js) in the console tab and click enter (in Second browser/ incognito tab). If you have multiple links do this same step in all those links (new tabs).

Now all the Subreddits and Users have been copied to your new/second account.
